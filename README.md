## Intro

## JS Definition

JavaScript has various definitions that can provide a better understanding of its usage and execution. Here are some of them.

**Javascript** - a high-level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
<p>Let's look closely at each part of this definition.</p>

- high-level: we don't really worry about any complex things behind the scenes (eg.: memory management);
- object-oriented: based on objects, helps to store and manipulate data;
- multi-paradigm: means here more flexiable, allows to use different styles of programming;
- programming language: gives instructions to computer to do different things;

**Javascript** - a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first class functions; a scripting language for web pages. 

- lightweight: easy to implement, has a small memory footprint;
- interpreted: no compilation instruction, it is executed directly;
- object-oriented: based on objects, helps to store and manipulate data;
- first-class: functions can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions, etc., offering more flexibility;
- scripting language: instructions are written for a runtime environment (e.g., web browsers);

**Javascript** - synchronous, single-threaded programming language.

- synchronous: executes one command at a time;
- single-threaded: means when one line finishes, it executes the next one.
