## Intro

## JS Definition

JavaScript has various definitions that can provide a better understanding of its usage and execution. Here are some of them.

**Javascript** - a high-level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
<p>Let's look closely at each part of this definition.</p>

- high-level: we don't really worry about any complex things behind the scenes (eg.: memory management);
- object-oriented: based on objects, helps to store and manipulate data;
- multi-paradigm: means here more flexiable, allows to use different styles of programming;
- programming language: gives instructions to computer to do different things;

**Javascript** - a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first class functions; a scripting language for web pages. 

- lightweight: easy to implement, has a small memory footprint;
- interpreted: no compilation instruction, it is executed directly;
- object-oriented: based on objects, helps to store and manipulate data;
- first-class: functions can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions, etc., offering more flexibility;
- scripting language: instructions are written for a runtime environment (e.g., web browsers);

**Javascript** - synchronous, single-threaded programming language.

- synchronous: executes one command at a time;
- single-threaded: means when one line finishes, it executes the next one.

> Names: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich'>Brendan Eich</a> is an American computer programmer and technology executive, created the JavaScript programming language. He is a co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.

 **JavaScript** (previously Mocha and LiveScript) - was created roughly in 10 days(in **1995**) as a response to the competitive <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars'>"Browser wars"</a>. Its development aimed to enable client-side scripting in web browsers, thus enhancing web functionality and user interaction.

###### Why "Java" in Javascript?

Java was extremely popular at that time, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape'>**Netscape**,</a>, the company behind JavaScript, wanted to capitalize on Java's popularity. Despite the name, JavaScript and Java are two distinct languages with different syntax, semantics, and purposes. The inclusion of "Java" in the name was primarily a marketing decision and does not imply a direct relationship between the two languages.

###### JavaScript versions

JS was standardized by ECMA in **1997**. So first standardized version of JavaScript, published as <em>ECMA-262</em>.
**1998** ECMAScript 2 (ES2): Minor revision to align with ISO/IEC standards.
