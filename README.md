## Intro

## JS Definition

**Javascript** - a high-level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
<p>Let's look closely at each part of this definition.</p>

- high-level: we don't really worry about any complex things behind the scenes (eg.: memory management);
- object-oriented: based on objects, helps to store and manipulate data;
- multi-paradigm: means here more flexiable, allows to use different styles of programming;
- programming language: gives instructions to computer to do different things;
